I have learned so many cool concepts in Python.
In Python you can store values as variables and work with them.
In Python you can also store large number of values using data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionary etc.,
In Python you can create small block of code to perform repeatable tasks called functions.
In Python you can represent real world objects using classes.
In Python you can get user input and work based on that.
